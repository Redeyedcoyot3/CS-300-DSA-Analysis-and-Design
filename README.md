# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course project, I was tasked with solving the problem of designing a program in C++ that could read course data from a file, organize it into a data structure, and provide various functionalities such as printing course lists and displaying course information. Some of the specific requirements included reading the course data from a file, implementing a menu that would interact with the data, sort and print course lists, and displaying the course information alphanumerically while also displaying the course prerequisites if there were any. 

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

To approach the problem it was imperative to implement a specific data structure that would store the course objects. I used a vector as a way to store the course lists while also implementing a hash table datastructure that could assign each object based on the hash function from the table size. The program also contained a menu that would allow the user to load the data from a csv file and print a sample schedule of the courses along with their prerequisites. The program also allowed a user to search for a particular course, which would then print out the course information along with any prerequisites if there were any. Data Structures are important when designing a program as they influence many factors of the program like it's efficiency, structure, memory management. Choosing the right data structure for the amount of data is a fundamental aspect of using data structures as each structure is unique and can result in various run-time efficiencies which may not be suitable for the specific needs of the program. For instance, arrays are greate for random access, while linked lists are efficient for insertions and deletions. 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? 

Throughout the project, i encountered certain challenges that required problem-solving skills. One notable challenged was parsing the data from the file and ensuring it was correct when the courses were printed, which was crucial for populating a hash table with the right course information. At first the prerequisites were not being loaded into the hash table then eventually i figured out that the csv file needed to be changed to a different format, with each row containing the same number of columns or entries in order to be parsed and loaded correctly. Selecting the right data structure was also challenging as I needed to understand the difference in run-time efficiencies of each structure and whether or not I would use that structure for my program. Eventually, I decided on the hash table due to its ability to offer constant-time retreival of course information, which proved advantageous in various program functionalitites. 

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My work on this project has significantly broadened my approach to designing software and developing programs in several key ways. Firstly, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of structured problem-solving. The project forced me to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components, enabling me to tackle them systematically. This approach has proven invaluable, not only in this project but in all aspects of software development. Moreover, I learned the critical role of data structures in designing efficient and scalable software. Selecting the appropriate data structure can make a substantial difference in program performance. My experience with implementing a hash table for storing course data highlighted the significance of data structure selection in achieving constant-time access and efficient data retrieval

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My work on this project has helped reshape my programming approach due to the meticulous consideration for implementing a hash table, analyzing the run time efficiencies of each, and also the use of various sorting algorithms to help load and print the data. Now I prioritize clear concise comments and add effective erorr handling for better readability and reliability. This project has helped transform my entire programming approach by helping me focus on core coding principles like creating maintainable, readable, and adaptable code.
